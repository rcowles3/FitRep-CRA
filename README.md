# lifequote

A port of an existing Flash-based life insurance quick quoting application to a single-page JavaScript app, built with (and to learn) [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Developing

Clone and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/insin/lifequote.git
cd lifequote
npm install
```

Start a dev server which uses Webpack to bundle JavaScript and CSS and hot reload any changes made:

```
npm start
```

Create a static build which will be used by the dev server when present:

```
npm start
```
